# 1crmOpenApi
OpenApi 2.0 (Swagger) definitions for 1CRM API

OpenApi is an API definition format, that can be consumed by a multitude of Tools, to automatically generate API clients.

1CRM offers a REST API (in Professional and Enterprise Edition).

This project was started in order to add 1CRM connectors to Microsoft Flow, therefore OpenAPI 2.0 is used and not the newer version.
